        <p class="more-para"> Soo-man (born 18 June 1952) is a South Korean record producer and best known as the
            founder of SM
            Entertainment, a multinational entertainment company based in Seoul, South Korea. He has also been
            referred to as the "president of culture", as he pioneered the Korean Wave.Lee debuted as a singer in
            1971, while he was a student at Seoul National University. He founded SM Entertainment in 1989, which became
            one of the largest record labels and management companies in South Korea. </p>

        <p class="more-para">Located next to Starfield COEX Mall in Yeongdong-daero, SMTOWN is a little far off from
            tourist-centric areas such as Myeongdong and Hongdae in Seoul. Taking the Green Line train from Hongik
            station, it takes about 45 minutes to reach Samseong station and another good 10 minutes of walking from
            Exit 6 before I reach the building. <br><br>
            But being a major Girls’ Generation fanboy, I thought that SMTOWN (which has no entrance fees) was certainly
            worth the trip. The long journey’s fatigue dissipates and excitement takes over when I browse through the
            iconic girl group’s album collection at the gift shop on the second floor. <br><br>
            In addition to physical albums, the gift shop also carries an array of merchandise. NCT key chains? Check.
            EXO dolls? Check. A painting featuring shirtless Yunho and Changmin of TVXQ? Mm hmm.</p>

    <p class="more-para">People these days are judging K-pop for all the wrong reasons, even sometimes disrespecting
        their hard work.
        Whether it’s the music video, idols, or the song itself, people always seem to judge K-pop and take it as a
        joke.<br><br>
        K-pop is a genre of music that is meant to represent South Korea’s type of music. The three biggest K-pop
        legends at the moment being BigBang, Super Junior, 2ne1 and Girl's Generation. These groups are the K-pop
        legends
        for making their music reach to the US. Originally for South Korea, they wanted to make K-pop well known to make
        more profit in one of their biggest businesses. But in 2012, PSY, came out with his hit song ‘Gangnam Style’
        which reached the US and ruined South Korea’s chance of reaching their goal since the song got so much hate and
        caused K-pop to look like a joke more than an art.<br><br>
        Ever since K-pop has made its way over to the US and become worldwide, people haven’t been taking K-pop
        seriously and even judge it for all the wrong reasons. Some people call K-pop annoying or even judge the male
        artists for wearing makeup and wearing certain clothes.<br><br>
        For example, K-pop trainees sign a contract to their company with a set of rules, expectations, and requirements
        each trainee needs to have. All trainees need to have at least average skills of singing, acting, dancing, and
        having the visuals. By signing the contract, these trainees are put on strict diets, a harsh sleep schedule,
        extreme dancing and vocal training, and much more.
        <br><br>
        When these trainees become idols, their company gives them song lyrics to sing, choreographies to memorize, and
        concepts to follow. Unless if the groups are far more successful, they get to write their own songs, have their
        own concepts, and create their own dances. But even if these idols receive a certain respect from their
        companies, that doesn’t stop the crazy training and sometimes idols even faint from poor nutrition and lack of
        sleep.<br><br>
        K-pop deserves better since they work hard and risk their lives everyday to do what they love. We should all
        have a little taste of K-pop in our lives.
