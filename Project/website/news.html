        <h3>Here’s Why Eric Nam Thought TREASURE Was An SM Entertainment Group</h3><br>
        <h3>Could you tell which company TREASURE belongs to?</h3><br>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uQnLMHQjFxOcH9bwYaGPUS8sIokdQWVBn8NpKsSRkljXEfoPqlF0VTGG2nmdGGRnYNTxknBtJs7D22-oXg9Nb9IkFhYThNwWdqlswDI8WK1hTg=w1200-rj-l80-nu-e365"
            alt="reaction of eric towards treasure" width="450px"><br><br>
        <p>On the most recent episode of Eric Nam‘s podcast, K-Pop Daebak, the star soloist revealed why he originally
            thought YG Entertainment‘s new boy group TREASURE was signed to SM Entertainment. <br><br>
            Eric Nam first met TREASURE on SBS‘s Inkigayo music show last August. At the time, TREASURE had just debuted
            with their first single, “Boy”, while Eric was promoting “Paradise” from his latest album, The Other Side.
            <br><br>
            This week, Eric shared that he also recently listened to the 12-member group’s latest song, “My Treasure”.
            The lead single from their first full album, The First Step: Treasure Effect, “My Treasure” features a
            bright, sweet sound and a colorful music video.<br>
        </p><br><br>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/quM3A6D5DYYvoYwgFY-g35yMbq4ycO-_ImfDKFoeSADDdY-IBH9_X6pq-zJWtr-0coDNyTlIn5pBnPW978KBp54Gl0GfbGwIP9M9UtLlU1Z2MWUb=w1200-rj-l80-nu-e365"
            alt="treasure" width="450px"><br><br>
        <p>While most fans know that TREASURE is YG Entertainment’s newest group, Eric reveals found himself questioning
            which agency the group was really under. But why? According to the soloist, it’s all about the vibe.
            Eric Nam used a Korean expression to describe TREASURE: “shabang shabang“. According to Eric, the phrase
            describes a vibe that’s <i><strong>"flashy, shiny, pretty, kind of bright, [and]
                    energetic"</strong></i>—just like some of
            TREASURE’s releases. <br><br>
            But while Eric says there’s certainly nothing wrong with the "shabang shabang" feel, it just doesn’t feel
            like YG Entertainment to him.<i><strong>"YG, I feel like, was always branded as like, ‘We’re so hipster and
                    so hip hop
                    and cool like we don’t give an f- about anything"</strong></i>, he explained. To him, TREASURE comes
            across as <i><strong>"such a
                    departure from what I have come to expect from YG".</strong></i><br><br>
            As such, every time Eric Nam sees a new TREASURE release, he revealed he finds himself
            thinking,<i><strong>"Are you
                    sure they’re YG? Is this not SM in disguise at YG?"</strong></i>. While YG Entertainment is known
            for an edgier style
            characterized by hip-hop as well as bad boy and girl crush aesthetics, SM Entertainment is known for a
            brighter style. <br><br>
            SM Entertainment groups like Red Velvet and NCT Dream, for example, are known for bright and colorful
            visuals and sounds similar to those in “My Treasure”. So, it’s no surprise that Eric Nam associates the
            monster rookie group with the agency. <br>
