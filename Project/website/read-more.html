            through which we communicate and share our emotions. As we say goodbye to 2020, which was a difficult year
            because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to cheer on the K-pop fans all over the world who went through
            hard times [this year], so we prepared this free concert in the hopes of bringing them bright energy and
            hope for a better future.” <br><br>
