        <h1>HTTP and Security</h1>
        <hr><br>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
            <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol used to send text - based
                documents like HTML. It was created to allow web browsers and servers to communicate, but it can also be
                used for other reasons.</p>

            <li>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</li>
            <p>HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each requirement is enforced independently with no
                knowledge of previous requests, implying that whenever the transaction ends, interaction between client
                and server is also lost.</p>

            <li>Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP.</li>
            <p>In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases: <br><br>
                a. The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not
                TCP). <br>
                b. The client sends its request, and waits for the answer. <br>
                c. The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate
                data.
            </p>

            <li>Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</li>
            <p>Both the GET and POST methods are used to transmit data from client to the server in the HTTP protocol.
                <br>
                The main difference between the two methods is that the GET method appends the request parameter towards
                the URL string, while the POST method appends the request parameter towards the message body, creating a
                more stable way of data transfer from client to the server in the HTTP protocol.
            </p>

            <li>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</li>
            <p>HTTP response status codes show whether or not such a certain HTTP request were completed successfully.
                <br><br>
                a. 200 — OK
                This is the code that browsers receive when every has gone according to plan. <br>
                b. 404 — Not Found
                The 404 status code is the most well-known among us all, showing that the requested resource was not
                found at the specified URL, and the server has no clue how long it took to find it.
            </p>

            <li>What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</li>
            <p>An HTTP cookie is a tiny piece of information sent by a server to a user's web browser. It's possible
                that the browser will save it and send it back with subsequent requests to the same server. It's
                commonly used to determine if two requests came from the same browser, for examples, to keep a user
                logged in. It keeps a record of stateless HTTP protocol information. <br><br>
                For example, if Path=/docs is set, these paths match: <br><br>
                a. /docs. <br>
                b. /docs/Web/ <br>
                c. /docs/Web/HTTP.</p>

            <li>Why are cookies a security issue?</li>
            <p>Cookies aren't harmful because the data they store doesn't change. They can't utilize viruses or other
                software to infect computers. Some cyberattacks, on the other hand, can hijack cookies and get access to
                your browsing activities. Their ability to track people's browsing histories poses a threat.</p>

            <li>Describe session hijacking and XSS</li>
            <p>Session hijacking- is an activity in which a person gets hold of a user session <br></p>
            Cross-site scripting (XSS) - is most likely a most dangerous and common method of web session hijacking.

            <li>Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</li>
            <p>Cross-site request forgery (commonly known as CSRF) is a web security problem that allows an attacker to
                trick users into doing things they don't want to do. It allows an attacker to effectively overcome the
                same origin policy, which is meant to keep websites from interacting with one another.</p>

            <li>What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</li>
            <p>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is an HTTP header-based system that allows a server to specify any
                additional origins (domain, scheme, or port) from which a browser should allow resource loading.
                <br> Simple requests <br> <br>
                a. GET. <br>
                b. HEAD. <br>
                c. POST.
